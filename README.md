# HackathonAalesund

Simple Java example of using the Disruptive Technologies (DT) REST API.

The example basically does the same as the Python example provided in the DT documentation, creating or fetching a virtual click button and sending click events to it every second until quit. HTTP GET and POST are demonstrated with Basic Authentication using a service account.

To run the example you need a service account key and secret as well as the project key, this will be provided at the hackathon. 

The example uses only classes that are shipped with the Java JDK.

### Compiling
